# AWS Audio Converter

This audio converter can be used in conjunction with AWS Lamba to convert wav files to mp3 by using ffmpeg

## library_location.py

This file will allocate the lib folder within this project and use it to convert the audio files with ffmpeg. 
Unfortunately, I couldn't find an other solution to enable lambda to make use of ffmpeg.
